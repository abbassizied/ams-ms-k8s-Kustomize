# Kustomize

- Kustomize is a tool for managing and customizing configurations for applications deployed on Kubernetes. 
- It offers a **declarative approach**, meaning you define what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it.
- Kustomize focuses on overlays and patches, allowing you to customize existing YAML manifests without directly editing them. This keeps your original files clean and reusable.
- Kustomize is **available as a standalone tool** and is also **integrated with the kubectl command**.
- **Kustomize and Helm** can work with Git repositories for managing Kubernetes configurations and Helm charts, respectively. 
- Kustomize is an open-source tool and is available as a standalone binary or as a plugin for kubectl.
